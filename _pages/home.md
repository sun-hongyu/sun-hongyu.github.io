#### Welcome to the Sun Research GroupÔºÅ

Located in El Paso ("The Sun City"), the Sun Research Group is affiliated with UTEP, where I serve as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Resource Sciences. I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Laurent Demanet](https://math.mit.edu/icg/people/laurent.html) in the [Earth Resources Laboratory](https://erlweb.mit.edu/) and received my Ph.D. in Geophysics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2022. Before joining UTEP, I completed my postdoctoral training at California Institute of Technology and gained industry experience through internships at TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil during my doctoral studies. Previously, I obtained both bachelor's and master's degrees in geophysics at Jilin University.

#### AI for Earth, Environmental and Resource Sciences

My research expertise spans geophysics, seismology, AI, and machine learning, with a focus on developing machine-learning algorithms to tackle complex geoscience challenges through intelligent, physics-informed, and data-driven approaches. My work aims to enhance our understanding of the Earth's interior, addressing energy and environmental challenges from a geophysical perspective and mitigating risks associated with natural and induced earthquakes. By integrating machine learning and big data, I explore subsurface structures and dynamics, including earthquake rupture, fluid migration, natural resource reservoirs, and geothermal systems.
