The Sun Research Group in the Department of Earth, Environmental, and Resource Sciences (DEERS) at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is inviting applications for several fully funded MS or PhD positions, starting in the Spring or Fall of 2025. We welcome students with backgrounds in Geophysics, Earth Science, Applied Mathematics, and Computer Science to apply. The application deadlines are November 1 for the Spring semester and February 1 for the Fall semester each year. Any interested applicants should contact Dr. Hongyu Sun (hsun2@utep.edu). Compensation and benefits will be provided in accordance with the regulations of UTEP. 

<h4><b>About the university and department</b></h4>

UTEP is an R1 doctoral university recognized for its high research activity. UTEP ranks in the top 5% of research institutions nationwide in total annual research expenditures. As a leader among minority-serving institutions, UTEP enrolls over 25,000 students, many of whom are bilingual. Designated as "Community Engaged" by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, UTEPâ€™s faculty have earned national recognition for their dedication to student success, teaching, research, and scholarship.

UTEP's Earth Science Program ranks 70th out of 166 in the U.S. News & World Report's 2024 rankings of Best Graduate Schools in Earth Science. With a single PhD program in Geology in 1989, DEERS was the first at UTEP to receive PhD-granting status. With a rich history rooted in the region's mining legacy and its excellent geological location, DEERS has maintained a prominent position within the university since its founding as the Texas School of Mines in 1913. The department now offers a BS in Geological Sciences, an MS in Geophysics or Geological Sciences, and a PhD in Geological Sciences.
